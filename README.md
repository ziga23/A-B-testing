#Gradient Boosting Implementation
This repository contains a manual implementation of gradient boosting,
a powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple simple models (base learners) to create a stronger predictive model. 
The project demonstrates the fundamentals of gradient boosting and compares the manual implementation with the sklearn library's implementation.

##Project Goals
1. Implement gradient boosting manually using decision trees as base learners.
2. Compare the manual implementation with sklearn's implementation by evaluating error metrics on a small dataset.
3. Explore the differences in performance and interpretability between the two implementations.
